The fashion industry supply chain, from seed to retail floor, is also incredibly complex, so it’s almost impossible for labels to be absolutely perfect.</p>
                                <p>We wanted to celebrate labels that were being responsible in the most important parts of the fashion industry supply chain, and, in turn, be able to buy clothing that reflects the values that are important to us, personally. To do this we devised our 8 Well Made Clothes Values: sustainable, fair, transparent, vegan, gender equality, handcrafted, local, and minimal waste.</p>
